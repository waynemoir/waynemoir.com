				<h2>Wrote my first mobile application</h2>
				<p class="shown">
					Today I wrote my first mobile application. It was great! I had huge amounts of fun, it was
					a lot easier than I expected, and I was so happy I spent the rest of the day celebrating.

				<h2>Wrote another mobile application</h2>
				<p class="shown">
					I am on such a roll with these mobile Web applications that I went crazy and wrote a second
					one. I am so happy I cannot stop singing at the top of my lungs. My cat seems worried that
					I've finally lost it completely, but I don't care â€” it's mobile Web all the way from now on!

				<h2>Must stop writing mobile applications</h2>
				<p class="shown">
					My fingers are sore from writing so many great mobile Web applications. I know that I should
					stop and take a break, but there are so many great things to do with this technology that I
					really don't know how to stop!

# About me

This online notebook serves as a place for me to reference tutorials, techniques and resources that I have found particularly useful over the course of my career in the hope this helps both myself and others to develop websites of exceptional quality.


My name is Wayne Moir and I am a web designer and developer based in Derby in Derbyshire. I have been working in the web design industry since 2005, during which time I have worked on a wide variety of projects for clients ranging from charitable organisations, to international and household brands.

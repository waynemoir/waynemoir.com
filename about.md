My name is Wayne Moir and I am a web designer and developer based in Derby in Derbyshire. I have been working in the web design industry since 2005, during which time I have worked on a wide variety of projects for clients ranging from charitable organisations, to international and household brands.


This online notebook serves as a place for me to reference tutorials, techniques and resources that I have found particularly useful over the course of my career in the hope this helps both myself and others to develop websites of exceptional quality.

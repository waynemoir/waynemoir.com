For many Photoshop users the pen tool is one of the most difficult and frustrating tools to master, its reputation is infamous and many users avoid it entirely because of this.

If this sounds familiar then I urge you to give the tool a chance and take the time to learn to use it, it really is one of the most useful and versatile tools that Photoshop has to offer. This [tutorial on the pen tool over at Psdtuts]( http://psd.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-tips/photoshops-pen-tool-the-comprehensive-guide/) should go a long way to helping master this amazing tool.

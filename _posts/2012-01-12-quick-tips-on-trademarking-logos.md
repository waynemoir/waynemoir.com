When creating logos suitable for trademarking it is important to provide the client with a simplified version of the logo, that is with all colour and gradients removed. The reasoning behind this is that if the logo were to be copied and a different colour used this may be seen as enough to qualify the copy as a new logo.

It also important to add the trademark ™ symbol to the logo, which as specified on the [Intellectual Property Office](http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-manage/t-enforce.htm) website is perfectly acceptable to use without the logo being registered.

> *(the ™ symbol)* … does not indicate that your trade mark is actually registered, only that it is being used as a trade mark. The symbol ‘TM’ has no legal significance in the United Kingdom.

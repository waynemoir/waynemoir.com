The most striking aspect of this book is the layout, each page is a double-page spread comprising of a left-hand page of text and a right-hand page that is a full-page illustration. At first glance you would be forgiven for thinking that this could be a method of padding, as a means to disguise a lack of content. However when reading this book it quickly becomes obvious that this style works very well as a method of maintaining interest and absorbing information effortlessly.

This is the type of book that can be read in single session, however it is also one that I will come back to again and again when I need thoughtful inspiration; almost every page had a tip that I wanted to put into action, or a phrase I wanted to quote.

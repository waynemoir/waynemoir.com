Lately I have been focusing on developing my knowledge of JavaScript as I feel that the ability to write custom JavaScript is the weak spot in my skill set. Whilst doing so I have found [books](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-JavaScript-Sparkle-Life-Pages/dp/0596521871/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1296042370&sr=1-3) and [online resources](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) to be an excellent source of knowledge. However one area that I have found both these resources to be lacking in is the reinforcement of this knowledge through practical application. To help me practice and further develop my skills I have been setting myself exercises. I am posting both these and my solutions here for future reference and to aid anyone else that may wish to practice.

## Exercise 1.1

Prompt the user to enter their name.

    			var name=prompt("Please enter your name");
    		
    	
    	
    		JavaScript Exercise
    	
    
    
    

## Exercise 1.2

Use a pop-up box to welcome the user.

    				var currentTime = new Date();
    				var year = currentTime.getFullYear();
    				var month = currentTime.getMonth()   1;
    				var day = currentTime.getDate();
    
    				if (month == 01){
    					month = "January";
    				}
    				else if (month == 02){
    					month = "February";
    				}
    				else if (month == 03){
    					month = "March";
    				}
    				else if (month == 04){
    					month = "April";
    				}
    				else if (month == 05){
    					month = "May";
    				}
    				else if (month == 06){
    					month = "June";
    				}
    				else if (month == 07){
    					month = "July";
    				}
    				else if (month == 08){
    					month = "August";
    				}
    				else if (month == 09){
    					month = "September";
    				}
    				else if (month == 10){
    					month = "October";
    				}
    				else if (month == 11){
    					month = "November";
    				}
    				else if (month == 12){
    					month = "December";
    				}
    				document.write(month   " "   day   ", "   year   ".");

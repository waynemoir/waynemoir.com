You may have noticed that a recent tweak to the design of this site shifted the layout from a static left column layout to the one you see before you now. In doing so I decided that rather than retire the previous design I would develop it further make it available as a free WordPress theme.

This theme uses HTML5 semantic elements, CSS3 and responsive design using media queries for greater device support. The key design feature is the static left column and it has been tested in WordPress 3.0. It is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license. You are free to distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon this theme, even commercially, as long as credit is given for the original creation.

I hope you enjoy using this theme.

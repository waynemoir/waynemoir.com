On Sunday the 20th June 2010 I will be helping out at the [Thank The Forces Military Fair][1] in Hailsham, East Sussex. Why not come along? All are welcome and there is no entrance fee.

The Military Fair is a charity event to celebrate the work of the British Armed Forces and will be a fun day for all. There will be lots of entertainment all day long with everything from military vehicles to motorbike and dog displays.

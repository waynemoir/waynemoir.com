When I first started out designing I often found myself looking at the work of others with admiration and wondering where their good ideas come from. To a certain degree I subscribed to the genius theory, believing that creativity is a gift people are born with. Fast forward several years and I have learnt that the art of good design is not passed down to a select few by the gods of design; but is a skill like any other that can be learned, taught and practiced.

This excellent article on [Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation from Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/02/21/clich-s-and-idea-generation-how-to-turn-clich-in-a-successful-visual-solution/) explores this train of thought and suggests techniques to help work towards the path of good and meaningful design whilst avoiding clichés. Along similar lines, this article on [the basics of designing from Web Soulz](http://websoulz.com/eat-breath-and-live-design-learn-the-basics-of-designing/) explores the fundamental concepts of designing for the web.

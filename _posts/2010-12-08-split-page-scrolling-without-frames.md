Recently I was asked to develop a solution to the problem of displaying two independently scrollable content areas side by side in the browser window.

The current solution used in the project didnâ€™t work very well and involved a mixture of frames and a strict doctype, which is not valid in HTML4. The solution I came up with validates to HTML4 Strict and uses JavaScript to detect the window height.

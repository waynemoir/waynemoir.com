In his presentation at [NUX Leeds](http://northern-user-experience.org/2014/03/21/nux-leeds-24-april-guerrilla-testing), April 2014 Chris Bush ([@suthen](https://twitter.com/suthen)) gave an introduction to the core concepts of guerrilla usability testing and provided tips for capturing notes that can save hours of analysis time.

<hr>

* Use Guerilla testing when time and money is short or if the project is still at the prototyping stage
* Use reflective questions but don't be a bastard, if the user is still struggling after five minutes help them out
* There are a million things you’re looking for and thinking about when moderating. If you’re scribbling notes you’re missing things and giving the user a poor experience, avoid this by using a scribe
*  A second set of eyes also removes bias.
* Make your users comfortable and don’t crowd them, make sure you’re out of their direct eye line. Your note taker should be sat further away, ideally facing a different direction and looking at a projection of the screen

* [Popapp.in](https://popapp.in/) is good for testing paper prototypes
* For mobile testing a [£5 device mount](http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2010/05/07/quick-tip-make-your-own-iphone-usability-testing-sled-for-5/) coupled with AirServer will allow you record the session using your usual screen recording software
* [Usability.gov](http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/resources/templates.html) has lots of check-lists and templates for consent forms and reporting findings


##Key time savers
* Having a scribe allows electronic notes to be taken in real time
* [Pear Note](https://www.usefulfruit.com/pearnote/) can automatically link audio, video and written notes
* Defining category's or common observations and using a text expander can greatly speed up note taking. For example Breevy for the PC or aText for the Mac
* Marking sections of notes in real time for pulling out as video clips later can save hours of review
* Leave half an hour hour between sessions for aligning and processing your notes. This keeps the team fresh and greatly reduces the analysis time at the end of the day
* Review and analyse the notes on the day, making sure to agree on priority and severity ratings
* Mind mapping themes using software like XMind can be a quick way to create a visually deliverable from the raw data

The true value of software lies in the ability of end users to input and extract data. Data input is commonly handled by forms and to a degree creative freedom is often limited to simply keeping the interface out of the way of the user; for me the really fun part is in the output of the data, where far greater creative freedom exists.

I am always looking for ways to increase the value of the software I produce and was excited to discover an article on [creating an animated bar graph with HTML, CSS And jQuery][2] from Smashing Magazine. Following this tutorial I was able to produce an exciting animated jQuery graph which falls back to a very accessible and good looking data table when JavaScript is disabled.

Expanding upon the tutorial I converted it to use a HTML5 structure and adapted the scale and animation behaviour to better fit the data I was attempting to visualise. You can view the demo or download the source created whilst following this tutorial below.

Thirty five is a tetrahedral number, the licence plate code of Izmir in Turkey, and the minimum age of candidates for election to the United States Presidency. To me the number thirty five is the position I placed in the [2012 CSSOff](http://www.unmatchedstyle.com/cssoff/), a global competition for front-end developers.

One of the driving factors for me entering into this competition was the valuable feedback that is offered by having other professionals review the quality of [my entry](http://unmatchedstyle.com/cssoff/2011/0237/) I am yet to review and address all the feedback I received but for comparison purposes my score was summarised as follows, placing me at number 35 of over 400 entries:
